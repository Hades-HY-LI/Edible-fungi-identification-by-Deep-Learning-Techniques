# Edible-fungi-identification
It's a project about identification of edible/non-edible fungi by by leveraging the power of pre-trained computer vision models ResNet.


Follow these steps in the **Code** file to reproduce the results of the project:

- Part1_CNN_Data_Proprocessing: import, transform, and load images;
- Part2_CNN_Data_Plotting: Plot/test the data loaded;
- Part3_CNN_Training_Functions: create model training functions for CNN;
- Part4_CNN_Visualization_Functions: create visualization functions for CNN;
- Part5_CNN_Testing_Functions: create model testing functions for CNN;
- Part6_CNN_Fitting_Testing: fit and test data with CNN;
- Part7_CNN_Focal_Loss_Function: import Focal loss function, and compare with CrossEntropy for CNN;
- Part8_ CNN_Plotting: plot confusion matrix, and feature map of each layer of the model;
- Part9_Other_Models_Fitting_Testing: fit and test data with LR, CNN, RF;
- Part10_ Other_Models_Plotting: plot confusion matrix, roc curve, pr curve for LR, CNN, RF, and different CNN models.
